That's it for this playground about React! I hope it made you like React or at least know enough of what React code looks like so you now have an informed opinion about it.

If you want to create a React application yourself, I recommend you use the excellent [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to get started quickly. This tool configures everything you need for a stellar development experience: a Webpack build and development tools such as live reloading and error overlays.
